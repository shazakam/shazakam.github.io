        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        This poem is inspired by two things. One inspiration is a recurring dream of my future life as a single father with three daughters called
        Éponine, Estelle and Élodie. The second is a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called "The Childrens's hour", due to the image it conjures which
        was eerily similar to my dream, hence, it felt very personal and touched my heart.

        <h2>Éponine, Estelle and Élodie</h2>
        <p>
            Sitting in my study peacefully reading a book,<br>
            Melodic morning spring tunes play upon my ear,<br>
            When all of a sudden, the floor trembled and shook,<br>
            I smile knowing what is to appear.<br>
            <br>
            I playfully delve deeper into my story,<br>
            The little stampede stops on the other side of the door,<br>
            I face the other way, so they need not worry,<br>
            I expect them to slither and sneak across the floor.<br>
            <br>
            I hear excited whispers of a concocted plan,<br>
            The door creaks and croaks, it is set in motion,<br>
            I am now prey, no longer man,<br>
            To these little three I will show all my love and devotion.<br>
            <br>
            They are adorable hunters in disguise,<br>
            Wishing to take me by surprise,<br>
            I casually finish the last page, the last bit,<br>
            I close my book, lo and behold! Here comes it!<br>
            <br>
            Éponine with a smile so wide,<br>
            Jumps at me from the side!<br>
            Estelle beautiful and graceful as a dove,<br>
            Seems to attack from above!<br>
            Élodie with wit and intellect sharp as a knife,<br>
            Charges in as I fend for my life!<br>
            <br>
            They chuckle, laugh and grin,<br>
            They declare “pappa you have lost and must perform a task!”<br>
            I know exactly the demand I must begin,<br>
            “It is Sunday morning! We want pancakes at last!”<br>
            <br>
            Pancakes were made and pancakes were eaten,<br>
            They giggle as Pappa was beaten!<br>
            Yet they do not know the treasure that I hold,<br>
            To be blessed with three daughters charming and bold.<br>
            <br>
            I smile knowing their stories have only just begun,<br>
            And there are still many songs to be sung,<br>
            But I will grow old, dusty and grey<br>
            And life may cause tremendous pain,<br>
            But forever in my heart,<br>
            They three will remain.<br>
        </p>
