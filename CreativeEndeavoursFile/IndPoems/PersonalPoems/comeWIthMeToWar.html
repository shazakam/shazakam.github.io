        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        This was inspired by Sonnet 29 from Shakespeare and in fact contains my favourite line from it (you will most likely be able to spot it). In Sonnet
        29 found himself in an anxious and doubting state of mind, yet he recalls that the love of a single person can cure one of these emotional ailements.
        Although it is easier for people to support when you are doing great, the sign of true compassion, comraderie and love is one in which you offer to help
        pull them out of hell when they most need it.

        <h2>Come With Me To War</h2>
        <p>
            I have come to you in my darkest hour,<br>
            At times where all I do is cower,<br>
            When I fall and can take no more,<br>
            Come With Me To War.<br>
            <br>
            You have made me laugh till stomach aches,<br>
            A witty comment, A sly grin is all it takes,<br>
            To fill me with joy to my very core,<br>
            Come With Me To War.<br>
            <br>
            Trenches deep, we dig with spades,<br>
            Together in the mud our wounds will fade,<br>
            “Look up” you say to gaze upon a star,<br>
            Some of us in the gutter, dare to dream up far.<br>
            <br>
            I am but a boy in this strange land,<br>
            Yet next to you I become a man,<br>
            In oceans deep, you bring me to shore,<br>
            Come With Me To War.<br>
            <br>
            Take the flank, I’ll guard your rear,<br>
            When I’m with you, there is nothing to fear,<br>
            O’Friend, O’Brother, O’next of kin to my soul,<br>
            Come With Me To War.<br>
            <br>
            Let hellfire rain,<br>
            Let my clothes with blood be stained,<br>
            Let not my heavy heart tire you anymore,<br>
            Do not Come With Me To War.<br>
            <br>
            Flee! Save your life!<br>
            Wonder not how my heart met this knife!<br>
            I am not what I once was before,<br>
            Do not Come With Me To War!<br>
            <br>
            I feel your hand grasp and tug my shoulder,<br>
            You shout “Brother dear you are more to me than just a soldier,<br>
            Let me carry you, you are not alone,<br>
            Leave this place and head for Home.”<br>
            <br>
            I am worn, I am torn,<br>
            Wishing never to have been born,<br>
            But your blessed memory cures me of such things,<br>
            That I scorn to change my state with kings.<br>
            <br>
            Life becomes less of a bore,<br>
            Knowing I have you to Come to War,<br>
            And as I have said before,<br>
            Next of kin to my soul,<br>
            <br>
            I will love you for evermore.
