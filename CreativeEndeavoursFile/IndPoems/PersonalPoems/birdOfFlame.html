        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        Sometimes you see the people you care most about go through disaster after disaster. However, we can help by providing a little spark. Pain and hardship
        are incredbily adept at transforming and strengthening character, but at times it may seem overwhelming. This is when it is important to have a jovial and smiling
        friend come in and with a little pat and a chat to lighten the mood and cause a flame to burn. It is then the friend's turn to sit back and simply admire and watch the 
        transformation occur before their eyes.

        <h2>My Darling Dear, My Bird of Flame, My Shooting Star</h2>
        <p>
            Troubled times will come,<br>
            Turmoil in darkness you run,<br>
            Hear my voice in the night wind,<br>
            Know I am not your fiend.<br>
            <br>
            Hear me whisper “Burn”<br>
            <br>
            Feel your wing grow frail,<br>
            Your sight turns pale,<br>
            Feel your muscles grow weak,<br>
            Shed tears, as you cannot speak.<br>
            <br>
            Look to the quiet tree,<br>
            See up high, it is me,<br>
            A Nightingale in my turn,<br>
            Hear me sing those sweet words, it is time to Burn.<br>
            <br>
            In a black abyss you hide,<br>
            No one but yourself at your side,<br>
            Lost in the chamber of your mind,<br>
            And gone is the time.<br>
            <br>
            A man walks in rugged, old and grey,<br>
            He has put a smile on his day,<br>
            He takes out a mystical mythical urn,<br>
            And says “It’s been so long dear; it is time to burn”<br>
            <br>
            He lies next to you and takes out his steel and flint,<br>
            Hitting them together causing sparks and tints,<br>
            Catching your wing, a flame is born,<br>
            You do not resist; you are too worn.<br>
            <br>
            Flames doth rise ever higher,<br>
            Eyes close for the last time with desire,<br>
            Let you fly again, amongst the clouds,<br>
            As ethereal smoke quiet or loud.<br>
            <br>
            Day breaks, the smoke has cleared,<br>
            It is not as the old man feared,<br>
            Clearing the ashes with his hands so sore,<br>
            He found you, more beautiful, than ever before.<br>
            <br>
            Remade, Reborn and Rebirthed,<br>
            Made anew in a warm hearth,<br>
            Feel your strength, spread your wings and fly,<br>
            Tear a streak across the night sky.<br>
            <br>
            Upon a mountaintop I will sit,<br>
            To marvel at celestial orbs in voids lit,<br>
            To see if I can spot you, near or far,<br>
            My darling dear, My bird of flame, My shooting star.<br>
        </p>
