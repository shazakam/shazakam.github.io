        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        My two week school trip to South Africa and Mozambique is one of my fondest memories. Spending a week in a bush camp in a a sweaty, smelly and 
        mosquito ridden barrack surrounded by nature and cut off from the net was so much fun. I even got to pet a beautiful cheetah called N'Tombe (She 
        was abandoned by her mother and hence, was taken in by the rangers and was used to being around people). We then spent a week in Bobole, Mozambique 
        building a class room for the local primary school. Although labouring under the scorching african sun was demanding, at the end of the day you would
        feel as if you had accomplished somethiing. You would also become so grateful of what you have in comparison to those who have so little, yet still
        manage to smile.

        <h2>South Africa and Mozambique</h2>
        <p>
           Africa seems to have a niche for wonder,<br>
           Followed by the thunder of our aching feet,<br>
           And occasionally, a sweaty seat.<br>
           <br>
           Through the Savannah,<br>
           And not into Havana,<br>
           I had a wabbajocky of a time,<br>
           And never was it,<br>
           A sour lime.<br>
           <br>
           With friends so great,<br>
           I believe we can say we are all pretty good mates.<br>
           <br>
           It is sad to say,<br>
           That we might float away,<br>
           After our graduation,<br>
           Followed by a celebration.<br>
           <br>
           I would rather go out with a bam,<br>
           While playing a bit of WHAM,<br>
           Than sitting on my ass,<br>
           With a bit of sass.<br>
           <br>
           Another adventure calls,<br>
           And the cheetah is a girl,<br>
           And therefore has no balls.
