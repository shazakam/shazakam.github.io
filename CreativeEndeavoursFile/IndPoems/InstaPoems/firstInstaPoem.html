        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        Well this was the first instagram poem I wrote, quite a spontaneous decision most likely due to an overwhelming sense of boredom. 
        This poem is about a former classmate who, at the party we were at, was dressed as a Greaser. I believe the theme for the party was decades, and 
        I think I was aiming for the 70s with my outfit which really wasn't all too different from my regular party outfit.

        <h2>First Instagram Poem</h2>
        <p>
            This Greaser is quite the geeser,
            He can make you like laugh,
            And probably likes baths.
            You may think he is greasy,
            But he isn't sleezy,
            That was very cheesy.

            He lives in the moment,
            Never late,
            And always on dates,
            You could say he is a ladies man,
            This is mostly due to his amazing tan.
            He likes rhinos.
