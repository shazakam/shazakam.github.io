        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        Who doesn't love turning 18? I had a wonderful dinner with my friends and I was brimming with excitement. I was excited to become an adult,
        to inch a bit closer to complete independence, the night before I had asked someone out for coffee on the coming Monday (who would later become my first love) 
        and was very excited for that, and finally I was excited to soon finish highschool. Overall, it was just a period filled with energy and joy.

        <h2>18th Birthday</h2>
        <p>
            It's the little things that make life matter,<br>
            Stopping the turbulent waves of any heartbreak shatter,<br>
            Perhaps a sailor on deadly seas will enjoy the perilous breeze in the company of fellow friends,<br>
            Who, even as the ship is going down will stay till the end of all ends.<br>
            <br>
            I am now lucky man instead of a lucky child,<br>
            Although my companions may be wild,<br>
            Every single one has a trait I admire,<br>
            Perhaps my love for them is never ending, much like the eternal fire.<br>
            <br>
            Melodic tunes colour the night sky,<br>
            As they all dance by.<br>
            <br>
            A night of toasts,<br>
            A night of boasts,<br>
            But most importantly a night for the deadly sea breeze amongst my friends.
        </p>
