        <h2>Commentary</h2>
        Captured in this post was potentially one of my happiest moments in my life so far.
        I was proud of what I had achieved, I had a wonderful sphere of friends all of whom I shared special moments throughout 
        highschool, I was in love for the first time, I was excited for the future that I was aspiring to reach and I had a loving 
        family to support me through it all.

        <h2>IB Graduation Poem</h2>
        <p>
            As I sit tinkering,<br>
            Listening to all the bickering the world has to offer,<br>
            I now know that I have a coffer,<br>
            Full of love and joviality.<br>
            <br>
            In this coffer I take the fun I require,<br>
            To avoid all daily banality,<br>
            Some may find these words to be insanity,<br>
            A most horrendous calamity,<br>
            But to surround oneself with these folk so kind,<br>
            it's difficult not to be in such a frame of mind.<br>
            <br>
            I know not where to go,<br>
            who to be,<br>
            What to do,<br>
            A never ending mold of messiness,<br>
            I confess.<br>
            <br>
            Atleast I know where I have been, <br>
            Who I have been,<br>
            And What I've done.<br>
            <br>
            But most importantly, I know the people I did all this with...
