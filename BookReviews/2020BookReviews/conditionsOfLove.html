                <p>
                    This is quite a short book. At only 146 pages in tandem with eloquent and comprehensible language it is not a long read. Yet, it's 
                    short and succinct nature does not devalue its central arguments. This is an eloquent and precise discussion on love. Armstrong draws
                    inspiration from art, music, philosophy, pscyhology and evolution in an attempt to clarify or at the very least give insight into how 
                    we as individuals perceive and create our perception of what Love is. <br>
                    <br>
                    The central arguments are the following, firstly, that love and the need to be loved is a deeply placed in human nature springing from 
                    inherited evolutionary characteristics and the modern development of self consciousness and culture. Secondly, love is an achievement which
                    is created and not found. However, it's achievement and creation is not something which can be forced by pure effort. <br>
                    <br>
                    Armstrong touches on various ideas such as Love as a form of education, the idea of "the one", the short term view of Romanticism,
                    recognition of the person we are, the role imagination plays in love, the difference between infatuation and love, and much more.<br>
                    <br>
                    The book raises a series of interesting and also important questions which we should all potentially attempt to answer to some degree.
                    What does it mean to love another person? How has modern culture affected my perception of love? How has my childhood affected the way in 
                    which I love and is it healthy? What is the difference between sex and making love?<br>
                    <br>
                    There were a series of brilliant quotes in the book, here are some of my favourites:<br>
                    <br>
                    "There are people who would never have fallen in love if they had never heard others talking about it" - La Rochefoucauld<br>
                    <br>
                    "Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves, A shining Furrow as thy thoughts in me" - Tennyson<br>
                    <br>
                    "For thy sweet love rembered such wealth brings,<br>
                    That then I scorn to change my state with kings" - Shakespeare
                    <br>
